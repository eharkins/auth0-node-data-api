# Data Storage Scenario using Auth0 + NodeJS API Seed

This is the Auth0 NodeJS API Seed project adapted to demonstrate the best practices of storing user data with Auth0. It is the backend for a native mobile app coded in Swift and based on the Auth0 Swift Seed project.

The scenario is a music app and the [User Data Storage Scenario](https://auth0.com/docs/tutorials/User-Data-Storage-Scenario) document demonstrates through this case the best practices of storing different types of data.
